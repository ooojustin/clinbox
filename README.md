Open source ommand line utility to generate and access disposable email addresses, written in Rust.

## Installation

Install using cargo:

```bash
cargo install clinbox
```

You can also download a compiled binary from the [releases](https://github.com/ooojustin/clinbox/releases) page.

## Usage

You can get started by using the `clinbox show` comand to see your random email address, and list the emails in your inbox.
